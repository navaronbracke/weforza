//We need a better calendar impl
//We have two components , the Header and the Calendar
//both should use a stream builder to display data
//The problem is, both need to work together

//if the header changes, thr body should too
//if the body gets swiped the header should change
//the body should also be able to add or remove for the selection

//TODO create a widget that merges the header and body + provides the inherited widget for the bloc
